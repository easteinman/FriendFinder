<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Puppy Pals</strong> is a compatibility app that pairs a user’s dog with another dog that we believe will be a good match for them. This is done by asking ten survey questions, with the answers being a rating on a scale of 1 to 5. We then take those results, find the closest match for each question and then calculate and display the overall best match for the user’s dog.</p>
